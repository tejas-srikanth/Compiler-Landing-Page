# SrikanthCC - A C++ Subset Compiler  
A high-performance, custom-engineered compiler for a well-defined subset of the **C++** programming language. This project delivers a complete **compiler toolchain** with a focus on **execution efficiency** and **optimized code generation**, incorporating essential stages such as **lexical analysis**, **assembly**, **syntax parsing**, **semantic validation**, and **targeted code emission**.

## Key Components  
- **Lexical Analysis**: Performs precise tokenization, breaking source code into valid C++ lexemes  
- **Assembler**: Converts intermediate assembly into executable MIPS machine code  
- **Parsing**: Implements an LR(1) parser for robust syntax tree construction  
- **Semantic Analysis**: Validates abstract syntax trees for type correctness and rule conformity  
- **Code Generation**: Produces optimized x86 instructions with minimal overhead

## Supported Language Subset  
The compiler handles a focused subset of C++, emphasizing fundamental constructs for clarity and speed. Supported features include:

- **Variables**: Only `int` and `int*` types, initialized with unsigned constants or `NULL`  
- **Control Flow**: Supports `if` (requires `else`), `while`, and `return` constructs  
- **Expressions**: Includes variables, memory ops (`new`, `delete[]`), address/reference operators (`&`, `*`), and arithmetic/relational operators  
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic memory handled via `new` and `delete[]`  
- **Function Constraints**: Functions must end with a single `return` statement

### Lexical Grammar  
The compiler recognizes identifiers, integers, standard delimiters (`() {}`), keywords (`return`, `if`, `else`, `while`), and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.). Tokens are case-sensitive, and all comments and whitespace are ignored for parsing simplicity.

### Context-Free Grammar  
Programs follow a well-defined CFG structure: functions contain ordered declarations and statements, with expressions built from standard arithmetic and pointer operations. Only basic types (`int`, `int*`) are allowed, and all code adheres to structured, predictable syntax patterns.

### Context-Sensitive Rules  
Semantic checks ensure proper typing, uniqueness of function names, valid variable usage (no use-before-declaration), and consistency in function calls. Recursion is supported, but mutual recursion is deliberately excluded to reduce parsing complexity.

### Semantic Behavior  
The compiler ensures that every accepted program is both syntactically correct and semantically aligned with C++ standards. This allows for seamless integration of the generated x86 code with C++ programs or toolchains, while preserving deterministic behavior.

## Source Code Access & Contact  
The source code is protected under intellectual property considerations due to the effort and originality behind its design. If youâ€™re interested in collaboration, reviewing the implementation, or contributing ideasâ€”especially as newer C++ features are being added (e.g., init-statements, concepts, structured bindings)â€”please feel free to reach out:
